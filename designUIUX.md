* Design in grayscale first
* Second add one color. Adding one color to a grayscale site draws the eye simply and effectively.
* Double your whitespace, To make UI that looks designed, add a lot of breathing room

* Overlaying text on images
    - Overlay the whole image with another color, black being the simplest and most versatile
    - Text-in-a-box
    - Blur the image
    - Floor fade - ever-so-subtle a gradient from the middle (black at 0% opacity) to the bottom (black at, ehhhhh maybe ‘bout 20% opacity).
* Drawing Attention to text
    * Size (bigger or smaller)
    * Color (greater contrast or lesser; bright colors draw the eye)
    * Font weight (bolder or thinner)
    * Capitalization (lowercase, UPPERCASE, and Title Case)
    * Italicization
    * Letter spacing (or— fancy term alert— tracking!)
    * Margins (technically not a property of the text itself, but can be used to draw attention, so it makes the list)
